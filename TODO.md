TODO
====

1. 	Callbacks; prefer closures and function factories.
2. 	Top-of-file description, todo, fixme, dependencies, notes, etc.
3. 	Applications
	* 	readmes
	* 	tests
	* 	todos
	* 	style-guide
4. 	Makefiles
5. 	Early returns
6. 	Do one thing; do one thing well
7. 	Bind this (instead of self)
8. 	For public libraries, do type/sanity check input arguments. Yes, type checking has computational cost (possibly a few extra conditional comparisions), but not providing such checking can be a considerable drain on your user's time. Subtle bugs can arise from using unexpected types. Be explicit in what you expect and write tests confirming your expectations.
